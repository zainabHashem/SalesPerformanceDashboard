# SalesPerformanceDashboard

**Sales Analytics Training Project**

---

## Overview
This repository showcases an **end-to-end data analytics training project** where I generated a realistic simulated sales dataset using Python and transformed it into an **interactive Excel dashboard**.

The goal of this project was to **practice key data analytics skills** including data generation, cleaning, analysis, and visualization – from raw code to actionable business insights.

The dataset simulates **retail sales for a fictional electronics store** (smartphones, wearables, accessories) across **5 branches in 2025**, with **10,000+ transactions**.

## Features

- **Data Generation:**  
  Python script creates comprehensive sales data including transactions, product details, branch info, and customer profiles.

- **Excel Integration:**  
  Exports to a **multi-sheet Excel file** for easy import and analysis.

- **Data Manipulation:**  
  Uses **VLOOKUP** for lookups (e.g., matching products to categories), data validation, and cleaning.

- **Interactive Dashboard:**  
  Built with **Pivot Tables**, **Slicers** (filter by branch/product/date), and **Charts** (Pie, Bar, Line) to visualize KPIs like **total revenue**, **sales trends**, and **top performers**.

- **Key Insights Generated:**  
  - **Total Sales:** ~200M EGP  
  - **Top Category:** Wearables (72%)  
  - **Leading Branch:** 6th October (by quantity)

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Pandas & NumPy for data generation and Excel export  
- **Excel:** VLOOKUP, Pivot Tables, Slicers, Charts, Dashboarding  
- **Environment:** Python 3.x (no additional installs beyond Pandas/NumPy)

## Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**  
```bash
git clone <repo_url>

    Install dependencies (if needed):

pip install pandas numpy openpyxl

    Run the Python script to generate data:
